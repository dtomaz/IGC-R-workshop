## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datacarpentry/R-genomics/gh-pages/data/Ecoli_metadata.csv", destfile = "Desktop/R studio/Ecoli.csv")

metadata <- read.csv("~/Desktop/R studio/Ecoli.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

head (metadata)

ggplot(metadata, aes (x=sample, y=genome_size, color=strain)) + geom_line() + scale_color_d
+
  labs(x="sample", y="genome_size", color = "strain", title ="Genome size per sample", subtitle = "Exploring the data", caption = "Source:Gapminder") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
